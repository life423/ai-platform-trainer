AI Platform Trainer
🚀 Trained AI vs. Trained AI. You’re caught in the middle.

🔹 What is this?
AI Platform Trainer is a machine learning-powered game where two AIs, trained in the same environment, battle it out—one chasing, one hunting.

An AI enemy is trained to track and pursue you.
An AI homing missile is trained to predict and intercept the enemy.
Both were trained separately using supervised learning, making the battlefield a real test of AI-driven strategy.
In training mode, the AI learns from its mistakes.
In play mode, you take control—dodging, attacking, and watching the trained AI models react.

🎯 Why is this cool?
✅ AI vs. AI – Not just scripted enemies; both the enemy and missile learn their behaviors through machine learning.
✅ Supervised Learning Done Right – The game records AI interactions, trains models, and lets them adapt.
✅ Tightly Engineered & Scalable – Code is structured for clarity, expansion, and real AI research.
✅ Easy to Play – Download the ready-to-run executable and jump in.

🛠 How It Works
Training Mode:

The enemy AI learns to hunt the player.
The missile AI learns to predict enemy movement and intercept.
Data is logged and used to refine both models.
Play Mode:

You control the player.
The trained enemy AI chases you.
The trained homing missile AI tracks and intercepts.
What Makes This Different?

The missile AI is smarter than the enemy AI—it has to predict movement, not just follow.
Both AIs were trained from the same supervised learning environment, showing real adaptation.
💻 Running from Source (For Developers & AI Enthusiasts)
If you want to tweak the models or train your own AI versions:

🔧 Install & Run:
bash

Edit
python ai_model/train.py
🔍 Behind the AI: How It’s Trained
Supervised Learning – Both AIs are trained using collision-based data logging.
Neural Networks (PyTorch) – The AI models process game states and predict movement decisions.
Training Data Generation – The system records AI behavior during training mode and uses it to refine decision-making.
