# 2D Platformer with AI Integration

This project is a 2D platformer game created using Python and Pygame, with an integrated AI model that controls an enemy. The AI is trained to track and follow the player, providing a dynamic gameplay experience.

## Features

---

- **AI Integration**: The game includes an AI-controlled enemy that attempts to track and reach the player. The AI model is built and trained using PyTorch.
- **Dynamic Player Movement**: The player can move around the game area with random or manual movement based on the game mode.
- **Collision Logging**: Collision data between the player and the enemy is logged to help train the AI model.
- **Flexible Modes**: The game can be run in either "training" or "play" mode.

## Installation

---

### Prerequisites

---

- Python 3.9 or above
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup Instructions

---

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd 2d-platformer-pygame-ai-scratch
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install Pygame and Torch (if not in requirements.txt)**:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame torch
    ```

## Running the Game

---

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment** (if not already active):

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Run the Game**:
    ```bash
    python3 gameplay/main.py
    ```

## How to Play

---

- **Movement**: Use the arrow keys (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`) or `WASD` keys to move the player around the screen.
- **Quit**: Press `ESC` or `Q` to quit the game.

## Game Modes

---

- **Training Mode**: The player moves randomly, and collision data is logged for AI training purposes.
- **Play Mode**: The player is controlled manually, and the AI controls the enemy.

To switch between modes, modify the `mode` variable in `gameplay/main.py`:

```python
mode = 'play'  # or 'training'
```

## AI Model

---

The enemy AI model is defined in `ai_model/model.py` and can be trained using `ai_model/train.py`. The model uses PyTorch to learn from logged collision data and predict enemy movements.

### Training the Model

---

To train the AI model:

1. Ensure collision data is logged in `data/collision_data.json` by running the game in training mode.
2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python3 ai_model/train.py
    ```
3. The trained model will be saved in the `ai_model/saved_models` directory.

## Customization

---

- **Configuration**: Game settings, such as screen size, player speed, and colors, are managed in `core/config.py`.
- **AI Behavior**: The behavior of the AI enemy can be adjusted in `entities/enemy.py` by modifying the logic and model integration.

## Troubleshooting

---

- **Missing Pygame or Torch**: Ensure that `pygame` and `torch` are installed using `pip install pygame torch`.
- **Virtual Environment Not Activated**: Always activate your virtual environment before running or installing dependencies.
