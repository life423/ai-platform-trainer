# **🚀 AI Platform Trainer**  
### **Trained AI vs. Trained AI. You’re caught in the middle.**  

---

## **🔹 What is AI Platform Trainer?**  
AI Platform Trainer is a **machine learning-powered game** where **two AIs, trained in the same environment, battle it out**—one chases, one hunts.  

- 🏃 **AI Enemy** → **Trained to track and pursue you.**  
- 🎯 **AI Homing Missile** → **Trained to predict and intercept the enemy.**  
- 💡 **Both AIs were trained separately using supervised learning**, making the battlefield a real test of AI-driven strategy.  

🎮 **In play mode**, you take control—dodging, attacking, and watching the AIs react.  
🧠 **In training mode**, the AIs learn from their mistakes, improving with every iteration.

## **🎯 Why This Project Stands Out**
✅ **AI vs. AI** – Not just scripted enemies; both the **enemy and missile learn their behaviors** through machine learning.  
✅ **Supervised Learning Done Right** – The game records AI interactions, trains models, and lets them adapt.  
✅ **Tightly Engineered & Scalable** – Code is structured for clarity, expansion, and real AI research.  
✅ **Easy to Play** – Download the **ready-to-run** executable and jump in.

## **📥 Download & Play Now**  
### **🎮 Quick Start**  
🔗 **[Download AI Platform Trainer (Windows)](https://github.com/life423/ai-platform-trainer/releases/tag/v0.1.0)**  

📌 **No installation required. Just download and play.**

## **🛠 How It Works**  
### **1️⃣ Training Mode** *(AI learns in a controlled environment.)*  
- The **enemy AI learns to hunt the player**.  
- The **missile AI learns to predict enemy movement and intercept**.  
- Training data is logged, then used to refine both models.  

### **2️⃣ Play Mode** *(You control the player. AI takes over the battlefield.)*  
- The **trained enemy AI chases you**.  
- The **trained homing missile AI tracks and intercepts**.  
- The missile AI is **more advanced**—it **predicts movement, not just follows.**  

### **3️⃣ What Makes This Different?**  
- Both AIs **were trained from the same supervised learning environment**, creating an **AI vs. AI battlefield.**  
- Unlike scripted enemies, these AIs **learned how to play** instead of being programmed with fixed behavior.  
- The **missile AI is more complex** than the enemy AI, proving **true predictive AI can be applied to gameplay.**

## **💻 Running from Source (For Developers & AI Enthusiasts)**  
If you want to tweak the models, experiment, or train your own AI versions:  

### **🔧 Install & Run Locally**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/life423/ai-platform-trainer.git
cd ai-platform-trainer
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_game.py
🚀 Train Your Own AI Models
To retrain the AI models from scratch, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python ai_model/train.py
🔍 Behind the AI: How It’s Trained
Supervised Learning – Both AIs are trained using collision-based data logging.
Neural Networks (PyTorch) – The AI models process game states and predict movement decisions.
Training Data Generation – The system records AI behavior during training mode and refines decision-making based on that data.
🎯 The result?

The enemy AI "learns" to chase the player.
The missile AI "learns" to intercept the enemy.
The game is a battle of trained intelligence—not just hardcoded logic.
