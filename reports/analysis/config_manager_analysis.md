# Config Manager Analysis

## Summary
The `config_manager.py` module in the root directory appears to be dead code that can be safely removed. The project has moved to using the more robust implementation in `ai_platform_trainer/core/config_manager.py` and `ai_platform_trainer/engine/core/config_manager.py`.

## Evidence

1. The root `config_manager.py` contains a simple implementation with just two functions:
   - `load_settings()`
   - `save_settings()`

2. The project now uses a more sophisticated `ConfigManager` class from the module paths:
   - `ai_platform_trainer/core/config_manager.py`
   - `ai_platform_trainer/engine/core/config_manager.py`

3. The only direct import of the root `config_manager.py` is in `ai_platform_trainer/engine/core/launcher_di.py`:
   ```python
   from config_manager import load_settings, save_settings
   ```
   However, this file also imports the newer implementation:
   ```python
   from ai_platform_trainer.core.config_manager import get_config_manager
   ```

4. The game now uses the `config_manager` service registered through the `ServiceLocator` pattern:
   ```python
   config_manager = get_config_manager("config.json")
   ServiceLocator.register("config_manager", config_manager)
   ```

5. The root `config_manager.py` functions are only used in the `SettingsService` class, which is described as "legacy settings service" in the code comments.

## Recommendation

The root `config_manager.py` file can be safely removed as it represents an older implementation that has been replaced by the more robust `ConfigManager` class in the core and engine modules.

Before removal, ensure that:
1. The `SettingsService` class in `launcher_di.py` is updated to use the newer implementation
2. Any other potential references to the root `config_manager.py` are updated

This change will help clean up the codebase and remove redundant code.
