# AI Platform Trainer Project Structure

This document outlines the organization and structure of the AI Platform Trainer codebase, explaining the purpose of each directory and how components relate to each other.

## Overview

The AI Platform Trainer codebase follows a modular and hierarchical structure to promote maintainability, scalability, and ease of understanding. The project is organized into logical components that separate concerns and follow the principles of clean architecture.

## Component Relationships

### Data Flow

1. `main.py` initializes the game and serves as the entry point
2. `core/game.py` manages the main game loop and coordinates between subsystems
3. Entities update their state based on physics calculations and AI decisions
4. The renderer visualizes the current game state

### AI Training Flow

1. Data is collected during gameplay via the `data_logger`
2. Training scripts load the data and train models
3. Trained models are saved to the `models/` directory
4. The game loads trained models during initialization
5. AI entities use the models for decision-making during gameplay

### Physics Simulation

1. The Python physics components define interfaces and high-level logic
2. For performance-critical calculations, C++ extensions are used
3. PyBind11 provides the bridge between Python and C++
4. GPU acceleration is available via CUDA for parallel simulations

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Components are separated by responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services are provided through a service locator or constructor injection
3. **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces define clear contracts between components
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a clear, focused purpose
5. **Configurability**: Key parameters are externalized in configuration files

## Future Considerations

1. **Microservices**: For distributed training, components could be refactored into independent services
2. **Plugin Architecture**: A plugin system could allow for custom enemies, environments, or training algorithms
3. **Web Interface**: A dashboard for monitoring training and visualizing results
