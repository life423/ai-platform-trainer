# Cleanup Plan for AI Platform Trainer

This document outlines the files that were removed as part of the cleanup process to eliminate leftover one-off scripts and old managers that are not imported by the game and serve no purpose in production.

## Removed Files

1. `config_manager.py` (root directory)
   - Deprecated and replaced by `ai_platform_trainer/core/config_manager.py` and `ai_platform_trainer/engine/core/config_manager.py`
   - Contains a comment stating it's deprecated and will be removed in a future update
   - The analysis in `reports/analysis/config_manager_analysis.md` confirms it's safe to remove

2. `ai_platform_trainer/gameplay/game_refactored.py`
   - Marked as deprecated with a warning
   - Functionality has been consolidated into `ai_platform_trainer/gameplay/game.py` and `ai_platform_trainer/gameplay/game_core.py`

3. `ai_platform_trainer/gameplay/game_di.py`
   - Marked as deprecated with a warning
   - Functionality has been consolidated into `ai_platform_trainer/gameplay/game.py` and `ai_platform_trainer/gameplay/game_core.py`

4. `ai_platform_trainer/core/launcher.py`
   - Marked as deprecated with a warning
   - Functionality has been moved to `ai_platform_trainer/engine/core/unified_launcher.py`

5. `ai_platform_trainer/core/launcher_di.py`
   - Marked as deprecated with a warning
   - Functionality has been moved to `ai_platform_trainer/engine/core/unified_launcher.py`

6. `ai_platform_trainer/core/launcher_refactored.py`
   - Marked as deprecated with a warning
   - Functionality has been moved to `ai_platform_trainer/engine/core/unified_launcher.py`

## Verification

The main entry points of the application now use the unified launcher:
- `ai_platform_trainer/__main__.py` imports from `unified_launcher`
- `ai_platform_trainer/main.py` imports from `unified_launcher`
- `run_game.py` imports from `unified_launcher`

The unified launcher directly uses `ai_platform_trainer.gameplay.game.Game` which extends `GameCore`, making the deprecated game implementations unnecessary.

## Impact

Removing these files simplifies the codebase by eliminating redundant code paths and reducing confusion about which implementation should be used. The application will continue to function as before, but with a cleaner and more maintainable structure.
