# Testing GPU rendering for headless RL model (2025-05-27 22:25:11)

@workspace how do I test if I have my gpu rendering the RL model headless?

To verify you can actually use your GPU in a headless RL run, you can use one of the built-in scripts:

1. Run the simple CUDA check  
   ```bash
   python ai_platform_trainer/cpp/verify_cuda.py
   ```  
   This will print out  
   • PyTorch CUDA availability  
   • nvcc version (direct compiler check)

2. Or use the full GPU-training verifier with just the CUDA check enabled:  
   ```bash
   python ai_platform_trainer/cpp/verify_gpu_training.py --cuda-check
   ```  
   This calls `verify_cuda_capability`, prints device count/name and exits.

3. For a one-liner in PowerShell/Bash:  
   ```bash
   python - << 'EOF'
   import torch
   print("CUDA available:", torch.cuda.is_available())
   if torch.cuda.is_available():
       print("CUDA version:", torch.version.cuda)
       print("GPU[0]:", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
   EOF
   ```

Any of these will confirm that CUDA is seen and usable on your Windows 11 machine without opening a window.

Now I need to focus on having my GPU, my nvida 5070 render the RL model working. maybe make a small mvp to make sure I have all the cuda core and c++ in my project right or that could be a bad idea. I DON'T WANT TO USE PYTORCH TO TRAIN THE RL VERSION OF THE ENEMY AGENT!!!(.venv) PS C:\Users\aiand\Documents\programming\ai-platform-trainerv1> python ai_platform_trainer/cpp/verify_cuda.py
PyTorch version: 2.7.0+cpu
CUDA available: False
CUDA is not available. Check your PyTorch installation.
(.venv) PS C:\Users\aiand\Documents\programming\ai-platform-trainerv1> https://github.com/life423/ai-platform-trainer the latest commit on the main branch is the same code as in my ide that you will be helping me with.

Here’s a minimal C++/CUDA “smoke-test” you can drop into `` to verify your NVIDIA 5070 is visible and can run a trivial kernel:

Create a new file:

````cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// simple kernel that does nothing but spin a bit
__global__ void noop_kernel(int *data) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    data[idx] += 1;
}

int main() {
    int deviceCount = 0;
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaGetDeviceCount failed: "
