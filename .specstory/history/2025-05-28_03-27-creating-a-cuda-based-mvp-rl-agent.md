# Creating a CUDA-based MVP RL agent (2025-05-27 22:27:55)

_**User**_

@workspace Are you building your RL environment and agents entirely in C++? Or are you using Python bindings for RL environment logic?

Do you have any specific RL algorithm or minimal MVP behavior in mind (e.g. DQN, PPO, Q-learning)?

Have you already written any CUDA kernel code, or are you just starting to test CUDA availability on the system?

Would you like help creating a simple CUDA-based MVP RL agent (e.g., tabular Q-learning with CUDA acceleration) to validate the toolchain?

---

_**Assistant**_

It looks like you’re using a hybrid approach:

- The core environment and physics kernels are implemented in C++/CUDA (e.g. see `physics.cu` and exposed via PyBind in `cpp/pybind/bindings.cpp` as class `PyEnvironment`.  
- On the Python side you wrap that in `gpu_environment.py` (factory `make_env`/`create_vectorized_env`) and train with SB3’s PPO in `train_rl_agent`.

So you’re using Python bindings for the RL logic, not a pure C++ agent. The default algorithm in the workspace is PPO via Stable-Baselines3. You already have CUDA kernels for physics; the RL loop itself runs in Python.

If you want a minimal CUDA-accelerated MVP (e.g. tabular Q-learning on the GPU) you could:

1. Write a tiny kernel to update a Q-table in `physics.cu` or a new `.cu` file.  
2. Expose it via PyBind (similar to `calculate_danger_map_kernel`).  
3. In Python, implement a simple Q-learning loop that calls that kernel each step.

Let me know if you’d like a more detailed stub for that MVP.

I don't want aMVP  if you think there is an easier way. and lets get pytorch and cuda all  unlinked

Here’s how you can drop all CUDA/PyTorch dependencies and force everything to CPU-only:

````python
...existing code...
-import torch
+import logging

 from stable_baselines3 import PPO
 from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import SubprocVecEnv, VecMonitor
 from ai_platform_trainer.cpp.gpu_environment import make_env

 def train_rl_agent(...):
     # force CPU device
-    model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1, tensorboard_log=log_dir, device="cuda")
+    model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1, tensorboard_log=log_dir, device="cpu")
     logging.info("Training started on CPU")
...existing code...
````

````cmake
...existing code...

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Remove all CUDA setup
# find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)
# enable_language(CUDA)
# target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE CUDA::cudart)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

...existing code...
````

````diff
- torch>=1.12.0
- torchvision>=0.13.0
- cuda-toolkit
+ # (removed PyTorch & CUDA – now pure CPU)
+ stable-baselines3>=1.7.0
+ gym>=0.26.0
````

After these changes:
1. Remove any `*.cu` kernels or guard them out so your physics runs on the host CPU.  
2. Rebuild your C++ extension (you should see no CUDA in the build logs).  
3. Reinstall dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).  

Now your trainer will run entirely on CPU with Stable-Baselines3’s PPO, no PyTorch/CUDA at all.

@workspace /explain dp I need the mypy.ini file?

---

_**Assistant**_

You only need a `mypy.ini` (or other config file) if you actually run mypy on your project. It isn’t required by Python or pip themselves.

When to keep it:  
- You want consistent, project-wide type-checking settings  
- You run `mypy` in CI or locally  

If you never invoke mypy (or don’t care about its warnings), you can delete it (or move those settings into `pyproject.toml` under a `[tool.mypy]` section).

@workspace do I need both .yml files in the root directory of my code
